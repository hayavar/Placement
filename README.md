# Placement
This project deals with to check whether a student is elegible for placement or not.
Here I have implemented Data Science to predict the status.
The user has to provide the Name and USN of the student to check his status.
If the student is present in database then it retrieves the data and gives the option button to predict it.
Here the algorithm used is Decision Tree with an accuracy of 95.5432
